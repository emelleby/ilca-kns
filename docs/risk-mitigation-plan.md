# ILCA-KNS Risk Mitigation Plan

## Overview

Simple, actionable plan to address critical risks before starting brownfield enhancement development.

## Critical Issues Found

1. **No rollback procedures** - Can't recover from failures
2. **No feature flags** - Can't safely roll out features
3. **Poor testing coverage** - Existing functionality at risk
4. **No user communication plan** - Users won't understand changes
5. **Missing monitoring** - Can't detect issues quickly

## Implementation Plan

### Epic 1: Database Safety (Must do first)

**Goal**: Ensure we can recover from any database changes

#### Story 1.1: Backup Verification
- **Task**: Create scripts to verify backups work
- **Owner**: DevOps
- **Estimate**: 4 hours
- **Acceptance**: Backup restore tested and working

#### Story 1.2: Rollback Scripts
- **Task**: Write rollback SQL for all planned database changes
- **Owner**: Dev Team
- **Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Acceptance**: All rollbacks tested in staging

#### Story 1.3: Data Validation
- **Task**: Create checks to verify data integrity after changes
- **Owner**: QA
- **Estimate**: 4 hours
- **Acceptance**: Validation catches all data issues

### Epic 2: Feature Flags

**Goal**: Control feature rollout and quick shutdown if needed

#### Story 2.1: Flag System
- **Task**: Implement basic feature flag system
- **Owner**: Dev Team
- **Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Acceptance**: Can turn features on/off instantly

#### Story 2.2: Management Dashboard
- **Task**: Simple UI to manage flags
- **Owner**: Dev Team
- **Estimate**: 4 hours
- **Acceptance**: PO can manage flags without developer help

### Epic 3: Testing

**Goal**: Ensure existing functionality doesn't break

#### Story 3.1: Critical Path Tests
- **Task**: Automated tests for user login, profile, basic features
- **Owner**: QA
- **Estimate**: 12 hours
- **Acceptance**: All critical user journeys tested

#### Story 3.2: Integration Tests
- **Task**: Test new features work with existing system
- **Owner**: QA + Dev
- **Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Acceptance**: No conflicts between old and new features

### Epic 4: Monitoring

**Goal**: Know quickly when things go wrong

#### Story 4.1: Error Tracking
- **Task**: Set up alerts for errors and performance issues
- **Owner**: DevOps
- **Estimate**: 4 hours
- **Acceptance**: Team notified within 5 minutes of critical errors

#### Story 4.2: User Experience Monitoring
- **Task**: Basic tracking of page load times and user actions
- **Owner**: DevOps
- **Estimate**: 4 hours
- **Acceptance**: Can see if new features slow down the app

## Timeline

**Week 1**:
- Days 1-2: Database Safety (Epic 1)
- Days 3-4: Feature Flags (Epic 2)
- Days 5: Testing Setup (Epic 3 start)

**Week 2**:
- Days 6-7: Testing Completion (Epic 3)
- Days 8-9: Monitoring (Epic 4)
- Days 10-11: Communication (Epic 5)
- Days 12-14: Final Validation

## Success Criteria

✅ Can rollback any change within 30 minutes  
✅ Can disable any feature within 5 minutes  
✅ All critical user journeys have automated tests  
✅ Team alerted within 5 minutes of critical errors  

## Dependencies

- Database Safety MUST be complete before any development
- Feature Flags MUST be ready before feature rollout
- All epics MUST be complete before starting brownfield development

## Next Steps

1. Develop epics
2. Develop stories
