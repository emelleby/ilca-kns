# Risk Mitigation Implementation Suggestions for PM

## Context for PM

This document provides technical context and implementation suggestions for the **Risk Mitigation Plan**. Use this to create detailed epics and stories.

## Why This Matters

The PO checklist identified **critical gaps** in risk management that could cause:
- System outages during deployment
- Data loss or corruption
- Poor user experience
- Extended downtime

## Key Technical Context

### Current System State
- **Technology**: React + RedwoodSDK on Cloudflare Workers
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: WebAuthn + email/password
- **Existing Features**: User management, profiles, basic UI
- **Enhancement**: Adding posts, events, training logs, media management

### Critical Risk Areas
1. **Database Changes**: Multi-club schema changes could break existing user/profile relationships
2. **Feature Rollout**: No way to gradually roll out or quickly disable new features
3. **Testing**: Insufficient coverage for existing functionality
4. **Monitoring**: Can't detect issues quickly when they occur

## Implementation Suggestions by Epic

### Epic 1: Database Safety
**Goal**: Ensure we can recover from any database changes

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use incremental migrations with transaction blocks
- Implement pre/post-migration data validation
- Create automated rollback scripts for each change
- Test rollback procedures in staging environment

**Key Implementation Patterns:**
```sql
-- Safe migration pattern
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Add new tables
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN club_id INTEGER DEFAULT NULL;
-- Create indexes after data migration
CREATE INDEX idx_users_club_id ON users(club_id);
-- Validate
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE club_id IS NOT NULL;
COMMIT;
```

### Epic 2: Feature Flags
**Goal**: Control feature rollout and quick shutdown capability

**Technical Considerations:**
- Implement simple percentage-based rollout
- Support user group targeting (admin, beta-testers)
- Provide admin interface for flag management
- Ensure flags don't impact performance

**Key Implementation Patterns:**
```typescript
// Simple flag check
function isEnabled(feature: string, user: User): boolean {
    const flag = getFlag(feature);
    if (!flag.enabled) return false;
    
    // Check user group
    if (flag.allowedGroups?.includes(user.group)) return true;
    
    // Check rollout percentage
    const hash = hashString(user.id + feature);
    return (hash % 100) < flag.rolloutPercentage;
}
```

### Epic 3: Testing
**Goal**: Ensure existing functionality doesn't break

**Technical Considerations:**
- Focus on critical user journeys (login, profile, navigation)
- Test integration points between old and new features
- Implement both unit and integration tests
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- User registration and login flow
- Profile creation and editing
- Navigation between main sections
- Authentication state persistence

### Epic 4: Monitoring
**Goal**: Detect issues quickly when they occur

**Technical Considerations:**
- Track API response times and error rates
- Monitor database query performance
- Set up alerts for critical errors (5+ occurrences)
- Monitor user experience metrics (page load times)

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- API response times (target: <2s)
- Error rates (target: <1%)
- Database query performance
- User interaction latency

## Success Metrics for Each Epic

### Database Safety
- [ ] Rollback time < 30 minutes for any change
- [ ] 100% data recovery in test scenarios
- [ ] Zero data loss during migrations

### Feature Flags
- [ ] Can disable any feature within 5 minutes
- [ ] Gradual rollout working (0%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
- [ ] Non-technical users can manage flags

### Testing
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] All tests passing before deployment
- [ ] <2% performance regression from baseline

### Monitoring
- [ ] Issues detected within 5 minutes
- [ ] Alerts working for all critical metrics
- [ ] Performance dashboard operational

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Must-Complete Before Development
1. **Database Safety**: Cannot proceed without rollback capability
2. **Feature Flags**: Cannot safely roll out features without flags
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Cannot validate changes without tests

### Cloudflare Workers Constraints
- Memory limits: 128MB per worker
- Execution time: 30 seconds max
- No persistent file system
- Limited outbound connections

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time: <2 seconds
- API response time: <1 second
- Database query time: <500ms

## PM Story Creation Guidance

### Story Structure Suggestions
1. **Database Stories**: Focus on safety and recovery
2. **Feature Flag Stories**: Simple implementation first, then management UI
3. **Testing Stories**: Start with critical paths, then expand
4. **Monitoring Stories**: Basic tracking first, then advanced features

### Estimation Guidance
- Database safety: 8-12 hours total
- Feature flags: 8-12 hours total
- Testing: 16-20 hours total
- Monitoring: 8-12 hours total

### Acceptance Criteria Examples
- "Can rollback database changes within 30 minutes"
- "Can disable feature X within 5 minutes"
- "All critical user journeys have automated tests"
- "Team alerted within 5 minutes of critical errors"

**Remember**: The goal is **safety first**. It's better to take extra time on risk mitigation than to deal with system outages or data loss later.
