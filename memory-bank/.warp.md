# Memory Bank Project Documentation

This repository contains patterns, practices, and technical context for RedwoodSDK integration with Cloudflare products. The documentation is organized into several key files:

## Key Documentation Files

1. `redwoodSDKPatterns.md` - Patterns and best practices for RedwoodSDK implementations
2. `systemPatterns.md` - General system design patterns and architectural decisions
3. `techContext.md` - Technical context and environment setup details

## Development Workflow

- All documentation changes should be reviewed for technical accuracy
- Use proper markdown formatting and include code examples where relevant
- Maintain consistent style across all documentation files
- Keep content focused and avoid duplicating information

## Getting Started

1. Read `techContext.md` first to understand the technical environment
2. Review `systemPatterns.md` for architectural patterns
3. Refer to `redwoodSDKPatterns.md` for specific RedwoodSDK implementation details
