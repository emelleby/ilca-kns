# Task ID: 17
# Title: Security Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures to protect user data, prevent common vulnerabilities, and ensure secure authentication and authorization.
# Details:
1. Implement secure authentication practices
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting for login attempts
   - Session security
2. Create input validation and sanitization
   - Form validation
   - API input validation
   - Content sanitization
3. Implement protection against common vulnerabilities
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection
   - Clickjacking protection
4. Create secure data handling
   - Data encryption at rest
   - Secure data transmission (HTTPS)
   - Sensitive data masking
5. Implement secure file upload handling
   - File type validation
   - Malware scanning
   - Storage security
6. Create security headers configuration
   - Content Security Policy
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - Referrer-Policy
7. Implement security logging and monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Conduct security testing for authentication flows. Test input validation with malicious inputs. Verify protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Test file upload security. Verify secure data handling practices. Conduct penetration testing. Test security headers configuration. Verify security logging captures relevant events.
