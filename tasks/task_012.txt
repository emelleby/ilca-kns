# Task ID: 12
# Title: Notification System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive notification system for user interactions, events, and system notifications using Cloudflare Queues.
# Details:
1. Design notification types and templates
   - Interaction notifications (comments, likes)
   - Event notifications (reminders, updates)
   - System notifications (account changes, announcements)
2. Implement notification generation
   - Event-based triggers
   - Scheduled notifications
   - Bulk notifications
3. Create notification storage and retrieval
   - Database schema for notifications
   - Marking as read/unread
   - Deletion and cleanup
4. Implement notification delivery
   - In-app notifications
   - Email notifications
   - Push notifications (future consideration)
5. Create notification preferences
   - Type-based preferences
   - Frequency controls
   - Channel selection
6. Implement notification queue using Cloudflare Queues
   - Queue management
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Failure handling

# Test Strategy:
Test notification generation for various triggers. Verify notification storage and retrieval. Test marking notifications as read/unread. Verify notification delivery through different channels. Test notification preferences affect delivery. Verify queue processing and retry mechanisms. Test performance under high notification volume.
