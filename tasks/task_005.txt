# Task ID: 5
# Title: Role-Based Access Control System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage permissions for regular users, coaches, and administrators.
# Details:
1. Define permission sets for each role:
   - Regular User permissions
   - Coach permissions (includes Regular User permissions)
   - Administrator permissions (includes Coach permissions)
2. Implement role assignment functionality
   - Default role assignment during registration
   - Role modification by administrators
3. Create permission checking middleware
   - Route protection based on role
   - UI element visibility based on permissions
4. Implement coach-student relationship management
   - Coach assignment to students
   - Access control for student data
5. Create admin-specific permissions
   - User management permissions
   - Content moderation permissions
   - System configuration permissions
6. Implement permission validation in all relevant API endpoints

# Test Strategy:
Test permission enforcement for each role. Verify role assignment and modification. Test access to protected routes and resources. Verify coach access to student data. Test admin-specific functionality. Verify UI elements are correctly shown/hidden based on permissions.
