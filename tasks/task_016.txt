# Task ID: 16
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations to ensure fast page loads, smooth interactions, and efficient data handling across the application.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting
   - Route-based splitting
   - Component-based splitting
   - Vendor chunk optimization
2. Create efficient data loading strategies
   - Pagination
   - Infinite scrolling
   - Data prefetching
   - Cache management
3. Implement image optimization
   - Responsive images
   - Lazy loading
   - Format optimization (WebP, AVIF)
   - Size optimization
4. Create caching strategies
   - Browser caching
   - API response caching
   - Static asset caching
5. Implement database query optimization
   - Index optimization
   - Query profiling
   - Batch operations
6. Create performance monitoring
   - Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Custom performance metrics
   - Real user monitoring
7. Implement server-side rendering optimization

# Test Strategy:
Measure page load times before and after optimizations. Test performance on various devices and network conditions. Verify Core Web Vitals meet targets. Test database query performance with large datasets. Verify caching strategies work correctly. Test image loading performance. Measure time to interactive for key pages.
