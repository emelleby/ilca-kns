## Development Patterns and Preferences

### Architecture Decisions
- **Server-First**: Leverage React Server Components for performance
- **Edge Computing**: Cloudflare Workers for global performance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Mobile-First**: Design for touch interfaces primarily
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript throughout the application

### Code Organization Preferences
- **Co-located Routes**: Keep related functionality together
- **Server Functions**: Use "use server" for database operations
- **Client Components**: Minimal client-side JavaScript
- **Middleware Pattern**: Authentication and authorization via interruptors
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation on failures

### Database Patterns
- **Multi-tenant Design**: Support for multiple clubs
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before server confirmation
- **Edge Consistency**: Design for eventual consistency
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient Prisma queries with proper includes
- **Migration Strategy**: Backward-compatible schema changes

## Current Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges
1. **Edge Database Consistency**
   - Challenge: D1 SQLite eventual consistency across regions
   - Solution: Design for eventual consistency, optimistic updates

2. **Mobile Performance**
   - Challenge: Large JavaScript bundles on mobile
   - Solution: React Server Components, selective client hydration

3. **Multi-club Data Modeling**
   - Challenge: Complex relationships between users, clubs, and events
   - Solution: Well-defined ClubMembership junction table with proper roles

4. **Authentication UX**
   - Challenge: Balancing security with usability
   - Solution: WebAuthn primary, email/password fallback

### User Experience Challenges
1. **Cross-club Event Discovery**
   - Challenge: Users in multiple clubs need unified event view
   - Solution: Aggregated event feed with club filtering

2. **Mobile-first Design**
   - Challenge: Complex sailing event data on small screens
   - Solution: Progressive disclosure, swipe gestures, touch optimization

3. **Offline Usage**
   - Challenge: Sailing events often in areas with poor connectivity
   - Solution: Service worker caching, offline-first data patterns

## Next Steps and Priorities
