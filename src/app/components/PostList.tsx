Wind was steady at 12-15 knots from the southwest, perfect for some upwind practice.\n\nThe water was surprisingly warm for January, and visibility was excellent. Managed to get in 3 hours of solid sailing before the wind picked up too much.\n\nAnyone else planning to get out there this weekend? Weather forecast looks promising!",
